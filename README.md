# hocala
A script for downloading instructor evaluations of Bilkent University.

Requires a valid VPN connection and headless chrome. 

These scripts were working couple of years ago and Bilkent is known for not changing the systems that sucks lol, therefore there is a high probability that these will be valid for another 10 years or so. 

Disclaimer: This is a terrible implementation.

AND I license this one with GPL-3, so not my problem anymore.
